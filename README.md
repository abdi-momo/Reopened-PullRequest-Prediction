# Reopened-PullRequest-Prediction
This project is about predicting reopened pull request in GitHub
In pull-based open source software development, a contributor creates a pull request and submit it to the main repository, when he/she wants to contribute to a project. 
The integrators inspect submitted code changes, identify issues, decide whether to accept or reject it and close the pull requests. 
Pull requests may get reopened again for further modification and code review, and these pull requests are called reopened pull requests. 
Thus, I designed a prototype system that consists of predicting any given pull request if it will be reopened after its first closure. 
Furthermore, in this system, we are able to make a prediction on each project we used during our experimentation and get the same prediction results as in 
the Decision Tree Predictor. 
In the end, in the application, we can get all the results of the reopening pull requests analysis.
To run this project, if you are familiar with the Django Framework, go to the PullRequest-Reopened-Prediction folder, then open the Final_Project and follow the Django process to run the application prototype.
